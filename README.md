# Multidimensional-Scaling
An implementation multidimensional scaling (MDS) using standard matrix/vector libraries. MDS starts with a similarity matrix and attempts to find an arrangement of points such that the distances match the observed similarities. This implementation, minimizes stress, which is the squared difference between the distances of items in psychological space and in MDS space.
